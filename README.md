## Tenzies game

### "Roll until all dice are the same. Click each die to freeze it at its current value between rolls"

<hr>

Simple game I made to pratice with React. 
I also used external libraries such as useWindowSize, Confetti, nanoid.

The game consists of holding each die with the same number, rolling the dice and trying to hold all the equal dice! When the game is finished the result will be saved in the browser's localStorage and will be shown on the page.

Try to beat yourself!

- Division of the page into components;
- Passing props to a component;
- Rendering components from an array using JavaScript's map().
- Responding to Events;
- useState;
- useEffect;
- Rendering different JSX depending on a condition (Conditional Rendering);
